        # Coronavirus content for NHS services: Symptoms

        ## How we write about coronavirus symptoms
        We have 4 types of content about the symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These are designed to be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.

        ### Short version:
        The main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.
      
        ### Expanded version:
        
        {{ expanded | safe }}

        ### Voice-friendly version:
        **What are the symptoms of coronavirus?**

        {{ voice | safe }}


        ### Full version:
        See our full page on the NHS website about [check if you have coronavirus symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/#symptoms).

        ### Where our content comes from
        Our symptoms content is based on official guidance published by Public Health England (PHE) and the office of the Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) of the UK. It is also aligned with content used by the NHS 111 service.
        
        The content has been adapted and simplified by our content team and checked by our internal clinical team at NHS Digital.
