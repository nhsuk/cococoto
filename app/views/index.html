        # Coronavirus content for NHS products and services: symptoms

        ## How we write about symptoms
        There are 4 main ways we talk about symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These are designed so they can be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.

        ### Short version:
        The main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.
        
        ### Expanded version:
        The main symptoms of coronavirus are:
        - a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
        - a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)
        - a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal

        To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital if you have any of these symptoms. Stay at home.

        ### Voice-friendly version:
        What are the symptoms of coronavirus?

        The main symptoms of coronavirus are a high temperature (feeling hot to touch on your chest or back), a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. A continuous cough means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours. A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal.

        ### What our content is based on
        Our symptoms content is based on official guidance published by Public Health England (PHE) and the office of the Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) of the UK, as well as content being used by the NHS 111 service.
        
        It was been adapted and simplified by our content team before being assured by our internal clinical team at NHS Digital, including our Chief Medical Officer.
        
        For an example of the original guidance, see the [guidance for households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection).
