        ## NHS content on social distancing

        We have 4 types of content about social distancing to avoid catching or spreading coronavirus (COVID-19). These are designed to be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.


        ### Short version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            To help stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), stay at home as much as possible and try to avoid close contact with anyone you do not live with.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content is best when space is limited – for example, a tweet or text message. It contains all the key information in fewer than 150 characters.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}


        ### Expanded version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            To stop coronavirus spreading, you should stay at home as much as possible.

            There are only a few specific reasons to leave your home, including:

            - for work, if you cannot work from home
            - going to shops to get things like food and medicine, or to collect things you've ordered
            - to exercise or spend time outdoors
            - for any medical reason, to donate blood, avoid injury or illness, escape risk of harm, provide care or help a vulnerable person

            When outside your home, it's important to try to stay 2 metres (3 steps) away from anyone you do not live with.

            If you can, wear something that covers your nose and mouth when it's hard to stay away from other people, such as on public transport.

            You should also:

            - wash your hands with soap and water often – for at least 20 seconds
            - wash your hands as soon as you get home
            - cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze
            - put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands
            - not touch your face if your hands are not clean
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content may be better if you have more space – for example, in an app or embedded within a web page. It provides more detail to help users understand if they have coronavirus symptoms.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}

      
        ### Full version:

        See our full page on the NHS website about [about social distancing: what you need to do](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/staying-at-home-to-avoid-getting-coronavirus/staying-at-home-and-away-from-other-people/). 

        This content is best if you have space for a full web page of content and want your users to know all the information and advice on social distancing.


        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}

        
        ## Where our content comes from

        Our social distancing content is based on official guidance published by Public Health England (PHE) and the office of the UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs).

        The content has been adapted and simplified by our content team and checked by the clinical team at NHS Digital.
