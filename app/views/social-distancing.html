        ## NHS content on preventing coronavirus

        We have 4 types of content about preventing coronavirus (COVID-19). These are designed to be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.


        ### Short version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            To help stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), avoid close contact with anyone you do not live with and wash your hands regularly.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content is best when space is limited – for example, a tweet or text message. It contains all the key information in fewer than 150 characters.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}


        ### Expanded version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            To help stop coronavirus (COVID-19) spreading:

            - stay at least 2 metres (3 steps) away from anyone you do not live with when outside your home
            - wash your hands with soap and water often – do this for at least 20 seconds
            - use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available
            - wash your hands as soon as you get home
            - cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze
            - put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards
            - if you can, wear something that covers your nose and mouth when it's hard to stay away from people, such as in shops or on public transport
            - do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean

            Follow the government's social distancing guidance about what you can and cannot do outside your home.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content may be better if you have more space – for example, in an app or embedded within a web page. It provides more detail to help users understand how to avoid getting or spreading coronavirus.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}
        
        ### Conversational version:
      
        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          
          {% markdown %}
            **How can I avoid getting or spreading coronavirus?**
          
            You can help stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) by staying at least 2 metres – about 3 steps – away from anyone you do not live when you’re outside your home. Wash your hands with soap and water often, for at least 20 seconds each time. Follow the government's social distancing guidance about what you can and cannot do outside your home.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        
        </div>
        
        This content is suited for voice assistants and chatbots. It's written in a voice-friendly structure – for example, by avoiding bullet points.
        
        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}


      
        ### Full version:
        
        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            See our full page on the NHS website about [social distancing](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/social-distancing/what-you-need-to-do/). 
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>
      
        This content is best if you have space for a full web page of content and want your users to know all the information and advice on how to avoid getting or spreading coronavirus.
