        ## NHS content on testing for coronavirus

        We have 4 types of content about getting a test to see if you have coronavirus (COVID-19), also called an antigen test. These are designed to be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.


        ### Short version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            If you have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), go to www.nhs.uk/coronavirus to get a test. Call 119 to get a test if you do not have internet access.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content is best when space is limited – for example, a tweet or text message. It contains all the key information in fewer than 150 characters.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}


        ### Expanded version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            Get a test to check for coronavirus (COVID-19) if you have any of the main symptoms.

            The main symptoms are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.

            You can ask for a test:

            - for yourself, if you have symptoms
            - for someone you live with, if they have symptoms

            Ask for a test as soon as you get symptoms. The test needs to be done in the first 5 days of symptoms starting.

            The test usually involves wiping a long cotton bud (swab) inside your nose and at the back of your throat.

            You can get a test on the NHS website. Go to www.nhs.uk/coronavirus. Call 119 to get a test if you do not have internet access.

            You may be able to choose between driving to a regional testing site or getting a home test kit.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content may be better if you have more space – for example, in an app or embedded within a web page. It provides more detail to help users understand about coronavirus testing.

          {% markdown %}
            **Who can get tested for coronavirus?**
          
            You can ask for a test to check for coronavirus (COVID-19) if you have symptoms. You can also get a test for someone you live with if they have symptoms. In England and Wales, you can ask for a test for a child who lives with you, whatever their age. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, you can only get a test for your child if they are aged 5 or over.

          {% markdown %}
            **How is the coronavirus test done?**
          
            The test to check for coronavirus (COVID-19) usually involves wiping a long cotton bud (swab) inside your nose and at the back of your throat. You can do the swab yourself (if you are aged 12 or over) or someone can do it for you. Children aged 11 or under cannot do the swab themselves, their parent or guardian will have to do it.
