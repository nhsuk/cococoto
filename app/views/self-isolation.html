        ## NHS content on self-isolation

        We have 4 types of content about self-isolation if you have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These are designed to be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.


        ### Short version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            Self-isolation is when you stay at home because you have or might have coronavirus (COVID-19). This help stop the virus spreading to other people.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content is best when space is limited – for example, a tweet or text message. It contains all the key information in fewer than 150 characters.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}


        ### Expanded version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            You must self-isolate if you have any symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) or live with someone who does.

            The symptoms are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.

            While you're self-isolating, you must not leave your home.

            -	Do not go to work, school or public places. Work from home if you can.
            -	Do not go on public transport or use taxis.
            -	Do not go out to get food and medicine. Order it online or by phone, or ask someone to bring it to your home.
            -	Do not have visitors in your home, including friends and family (except for people providing essential care).
            -	Do not go out to exercise. Exercise at home or in your garden, if you have one.

            If you have symptoms, you'll usually need to self-isolate for at least 7 days. 

            If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll usually need to self-isolate for 14 days. This is because it can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content may be better if you have more space – for example, in an app or embedded within a web page. It provides more detail to help users understand how and when to self-isolate.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}
        
        ### Conversational version:

            **When do I need to self-isolate?**
          
            You must self-isolate if you have symptoms of coronavirus or live with someone who does. This means you must not leave your home for any reason. If you have symptoms, you must self-isolate for at least 7 days from when your symptoms started. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you must self-isolate for 14 days. This is because it can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        
        </div>
        
        This content is suited for voice assistants and chatbots. It's written in a voice-friendly structure – for example, by avoiding bullet points.
        
        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}
