        ## NHS content on coronavirus symptoms
        We have 4 types of content about the symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19).
        These are designed to be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.

        ### Short version:
        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4 nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            The main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>
      
        This content is best when space is limited – for example, a tweet or text message. It contains all the key information in fewer than 150 characters.
         
        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}

        ### Expanded version:
        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {{ expanded | safe }}
        </div>
        
        This content may be better if you have more space – for example, in an app or embedded within a web page. It provides more detail to help users understand if they have coronavirus symptoms.
        
        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}
        
        ### Conversational version:
        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            **What are the symptoms of coronavirus?**

            {{ voice | safe }}
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>
        
        This content is suited for voice assistants and chatbots. It provides the same detail as the expanded version, but with a voice-friendly structure – for example, by avoiding bullet points.
        
        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}

        ### Full version:
        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            See our full page on the NHS website about [check if you have coronavirus symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/#symptoms).
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>
        
        This content is best if you have space for a full web page of content and want your users to know all the information and advice on coronavirus symptoms. 
       
        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}

        ## Where our content comes from
        Our symptoms content is based on official guidance published by Public Health England (PHE) and the office of the UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs). 
        
        It is also aligned with content used by the NHS 111 service.
        
        The content has been adapted and simplified by our content team and checked by the clinical team at NHS Digital.
      
        **Original guidance:**
        - [GOV.UK: Stay at home guidance for households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance) (last updated 18 May 2020)
