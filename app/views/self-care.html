        ## NHS content on coronavirus self-care

        We have 4 types of content about self-care for coronavirus (COVID-19). These are designed to be used in different contexts and across a range of products and services.


        ### Short version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            While you're staying at home with coronavirus (COVID-19), you can ease mild symptoms by resting, drinking plenty of fluids and taking painkillers.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content is best when space is limited – for example, a tweet or text message. It contains all the key information in fewer than 150 characters.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}


        ### Expanded version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            There are things you can do to treat mild symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) while you're staying at home (self-isolating).

            If you have a high temperature:

            - get lots of rest
            - drink plenty of fluids (water is best) to avoid dehydration – drink enough so your pee is light yellow and clear
            - take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel uncomfortable

            If you have a cough:

            - avoid lying on your back – lie on your side or sit upright instead
            - try having a teaspoon of honey – but do not give honey to babies under 12 months

            If you feel breathless:

            - keep your room cool by turning the heating down or opening a window – do not use a fan as it may spread the virus
            - sit upright in a chair and relax your shoulders
            - try breathing slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth, with your lips together like you're gently blowing out a candle
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content may be better if you have more space – for example, in an app or embedded within a web page. It provides more detail to help users understand if they have coronavirus symptoms.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}

        
        ### Conversational version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
            **How can I treat the symptoms of coronavirus?**

            To help yourself stay well while you're at home with coronavirus (COVID-19): get lots of rest and sleep, take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you feel uncomfortable, and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration – drink enough so your pee is light yellow and clear. A teaspoon of honey can sometimes help ease a cough, but do not give honey to babies under 12 months.
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>

        This content is suited for voice assistants and chatbots. It provides similar detail to the expanded version, but with a voice-friendly structure – for example, by avoiding bullet points.

        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}


        ### Full version:

        <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-4">
          {% markdown %}
        See our full page on the NHS website about [how to treat coronavirus symptoms at home](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-and-treatment/how-to-treat-symptoms-at-home/). 
          {% endmarkdown %}
        </div>
      
        This content is best if you have space for a full web page of content and want your users to know all the information and advice on coronavirus symptoms.


        {% include('./includes/how-to-use.html') %}
